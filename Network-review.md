## Networking

- dotted quad (format of IPv4 address)
- host
- subnet
  - Network prefix
  - Subnet mask
  - CIDR notation (substitute for long form subnet mask)
- gateway
- routing
  - Read a routing table for where traffic will be routed
- MAC addresses
  - arp table associates MAC with IP
- Hardware interface names (common)
  - eth0, wifi0 / wlan0, lo
- DNS
  - Local hostname resolution
    - Role of /etc/hosts
    - Role of /etc/resov.conf
- Ports (common)
  - 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS)
  - Read output of netstat with flags (-n -t -l)
- What an IP address tells you about the network:
  - Private network prefixes:
    - 10.0.0.0/8
    - 192.168.0.0/16
    - 172.16.0.0/12
  - Local network prefixes:
    - 127.0.0.0/8
- Router (as separate hardware):
  - NAT
  - DHCP
- Firewall
  - INPUT, OUTPUT, FORWARD chains
  - Can be managed at router level or host level
  - Host level management in Linux: iptables
  - Packet is blocked by first rule that matches in chain
- Forward proxy vs VPN
- Reverse proxies:
  - Caching
  - Load balancing (web servers)
    - Monitor services?
    - Allocation strategies
    - Connection maintainence
    - Session persistence
